Trends observed in the data:
One observable trend in this data is that charter school students score better on standardized tests than public district schools. Another trend is that average test scores actually go down as per-student spending increases. This data does not account for the location of these schools, and the income levels of these different areas. While school spending can impact student performance, so can access to resources at home.
